#data Structures

A collection of Go code for me to re-learn data structures including:

* [**Stacks**](/stack)
    A fixed size structure with push and pop methods, following the FIFO rule (first in, last out)
    
* [**Queues**](/queue)
    A fixed size structure with add and del methods, following the FILO rule (first in, first out)
