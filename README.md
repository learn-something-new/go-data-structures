# Go Data Structures

[![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-something-new/learn-something-new.github.io/master/logo.png?v=2)](#)

A collection of [Go](https://golang.org/) code for me to re-learn data structures including:

## Table of Contents

* [Stacks](/stack)
* [Queues](/queue)
* [Linked Lists](/linkedlist)
* [Doubly Linked Lists](/doublylinkedlist)


# [Stacks](/stack)

A fixed size structure with push and pop methods, following the FILO rule (first in, last out).
    
# [Queues](/queue)

A fixed size structure with add and del methods, following the FIFO rule (first in, first out).
    
# [Linked Lists](/linkedlist)

A non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in
the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list. Their is no first or last out rule that applies to this
list as it allows the removal of any item in any order.
    
# [Doubly Linked Lists](/doublylinkedlist)

A non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in
the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list as well the previous. Their is no first or last out rule that applies 
to this list as it allows the removal of any item in any order.
